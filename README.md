# swole-streak
sammi extension for managing user streaks


VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS.

Keeps track of users showing up to your stream. Currently, activated when they chat, but you could customize it to go off of channel points.

If users don't come to the next stream, then they lose their streak.

## Usage
Install the sef file. That's it :)
